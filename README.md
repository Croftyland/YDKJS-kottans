#### Our basic rules

* Respect each other.
* [There is no such thing as a stupid question][wiki-stupid-question].
* Each person learns with their own speed, has different background and
  personality, please respect this.
* Communicating and understanding people that are different from you
  can be beneficial to both parties, provided mutual respect.
* We are against any discriminations by gender, age, the color of skin,
  disabilities or any other.
* We respect intellectual property - there is hard work of an author
  or a group of authors behind all materials that we use.
